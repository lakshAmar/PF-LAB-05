## LAB OBJECTIVES
The main goal of this lab is to learn and apply logical decision-making structures in C programming.
It focuses on understanding how to control program execution using conditional statements so that
programs can make decisions based on given inputs and conditions. The lab emphasizes the use of if,
if-else, and switch statements to manage different situations effectively. It also helps develop skills
in using relational and logical operators to create complex conditions, improving the interactivity, 
efficiency, and overall performance of programs.
